- Wow people are doing some great work
- Inspiring to see people proudly sharing GitHub links
- Wouldn't it be amazing if everyone knew about and used this work

- I had a great time
- Mostly because there was a massive slide which I went down
- Eye opening listening to different stories

Am I just being naive?
Is this a dream or a possibility?

- This is awesome, but I think we can take it to the next level
- To do this I think we need to shift from thinking about reproducibility to reuseability

:::{.notes}
How comfortable as analysts and data scientists are we with picking up someone else's work to use for something we could implement ourselves?
 
Obviously we do this with every package we use, so clearly "to some extent". But in My feeling is that many of us are just not that used to or comfortable with that process yet.

## What are the challenges?

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- NHS is not one organisation
- Nervousness developing in public
- Thinking small
- Discoverability
- Upskilling in package development
- Infrastructure
- Resource

:::
::: {.column}

![Illustration of a woman kicking a ball at a wall to break it.](img/undraw-barriers.svg)\

:::
::::

:::{.notes}
Thinking small - my problem is unique so I can't use other code / it won't be useful
Can't find other work - example me and Matt
Some of these things we can't change - but some we can
:::

# What can we do?

![Illustration of a person rearranging three profile pictures of other people.](img/undraw-connecting.svg)\

## Build modular code

::::{.columns}
::: {.column}
- Think big picture
- Design smaller, more modular functions
- Build packages
- Write for humans
:::
::: {.column}

![Illustration of a person putting bricks into a hole in the wall.](img/undraw-build.svg)\
:::
::::

:::{.notes}
Instead of making helper functions available in a script in a repo - make a package
:::

## Shout about it


::::{.columns}
::: {.column}

![Illustration of a woman speaking at a podium.](img/undraw-candidate.svg)\


:::
::: {.column}

- Write and speak about your work
- Don't wait until it's finished to share
- Seek others who might be interested
- Ask to see code
- Shout loud, be curious [üéôÔ∏è](https://thettlpodcast.com/)

:::{.notes}
- You're here which is a great start
- Tactics for Tech Leadership Podcast (Andrew Parker)
:::

## Reward reusablility

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Borrow with pride 
- Celebrate those who share
- ...and those who adapt it
- Could we have a reusability contest?

:::
::: {.column}

![Illustration of a two people high-fiving.](img/undraw-winners.svg)\

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
As a community we need to value and recognise reusiblity
This is the opposite to the academic model
There is still some shame about "I borrowed this code‚Äù or "I got this from stack overflow" We need to flip that to pride. 
"I looked around and found something before wasting time doing it"- GREAT!
Go forth and steal 
Re-useablity contest
